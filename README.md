# check-vene-passport-chile

You can check if the link to the PDF that holds the list of passports that can be retrieved was changed.

# Usage

Install node, then:

```
npm install -g check-vene-passport-chile
check-vene-passport-chile
```

# Why?

I was tired of checking a PDF to know if my passport is ready to be retrieved :P.
