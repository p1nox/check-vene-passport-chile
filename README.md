# check-vene-passport-chile

You can check if the link to the PDF that holds the list of passports that can be retrieved was changed.

# Usage

Install node, then:

```
git clone git@github.com:p1nox/check-vene-passport-chile.git
cd check-vene-passport-chile
npm install
node .
```

# Why?

I was tired of checking a PDF to know if my passport is ready to be retrieved :P.
